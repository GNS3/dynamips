=== Dynamips-0.2.8-RC3-community ===

This an unofficial version provided without warranty, based on a
development version and improved with patches wrote by various people
from the community.

You can compile two different versions of dynamips with this code.
Edit the Makefile to set the flags to suit your environment.
One of the flags, DYNAMIPS_CODE, can be "stable" or "unstable".

Unstable is the code which contains most of the development code, and is
in particular suitable for use on a 64 bit Mac. Unfortunately this has
proved to be unstable on other platforms.

Stable contains the same code as Unstable, minus some mips64 bit optimisations
and tcb code which seems to trigger instability on a number of platforms.
You should probably use stable unless you have a very good reason.

Patch by Christophe Fillot:

 - Online Insertion and Removal (OIR) support for c3745 (NM-4T only) and c3660.
 - c7200: support for jacket card (C7200-JC-PA) and support for PA in slot 7.
 - ATM: AAL5 CRC bug fix.
 - New Multicast NIO.
 - "nio set_mcast_ttl" hypervisor command to change TTL for multicast NIOs.
 - 64-bit support for MacOS X 10.5 - Leopard (stack alignment).
 - PPC32: DIVW instruction fix (incorrect cast: unsigned instead of signed).
   This was causing problems with OSPF (and probably other protocols)
   on 2600 platforms.
 - Some minor info added (OS name) to ease debugging.
 - NIO traffic statistics (packets/bytes in/out).
 - QinQ support in integrated Ethernet switch.
 - More coherent naming for JIT variables ("blocks" -> "tcb").
 - PPC-host JIT patch from Zhe Fang.
 - JIT code sharing system (only MIPS ported at this time)
 - MIPS64 fixes in handling of TLB entries.
 - "udp auto" NIO to avoid fixed port allocation which can easily fail.
 - Bug fixes in socket handling (incorrect setsockopt() for non-RFC2553 systems)

Patch by Gordon Russell:

 - New source code layout to allow stable and unstable to share code
   in common in a single distribution.
 - Able to set system id at runtime in cli mode using -I <systemid> or
   set_system_id in hypervisor mode. This is for routers
   1700,2600,3600,3725,3745, and 7200 (not npe-400 or npe-g1 or 2).
   System id format is dependent on router, e.g. -I 4279256517 or
   -I FTX0945W0MY (these are the current defaults).
 - AUX port for routers 1700 to 3745 now works.
 - u16552 correctly emulates the latch bit, and decodes more registers.
 - Telnet to AUX or CONSOLE is flushed much earlier.
 - Make clean improved.
 - IOS reload command for non c7200 now terminates the emulation.
 - Setting mac address using -m works for non c7200 as well.
 - Using inappropriate flag which is platform sensitive gives an error.
 - Flag added --noctrl which disables ctrl+]
 - Flag added --notelnetmsg which disables welcome text on telnet
   AUX and CONSOLE.
 - Flag added --filepid <filename> which saves the pid of dynamips to a file.
 - Bug fix: xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx mac addresses in -m now accepted.
 - Bug fix: JayTee patch included for sizeof error in networking
 - Bug fix: closing telnet to AUX/CONSOLE may produce SIGPIPE which is now trapped when using non hypervisor mode.
 - Bug fix: ghost file using -G now opened correctly as READONLY.

Other patches:

 - Cisco Pagent and CallGen image support for c1700, c2600, c36xx, c37xx, c7200 NPE-100 to NPE-300:
