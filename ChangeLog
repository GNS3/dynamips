  - Some code factorization.

21-Sep-2005
-----------
  - Added CPU state save/restore on disk.
  - Sending SIGQUIT to the process dumps the MIPS64 VM state on disk.
    (only CPU state is saved for now).
    Device state is not saved, so this does not work with booted IOS images
    for now (it works for an IOS image being self-decompressing, though).

-----------
  - A lot of work on amd64 jit compiler.
  - The memory management should be 64-bit compliant now.

17-Oct-2005

  - Fixed BREAK instruction (x86/amd64).
  - Fixed 2 GB limit for log file.
  - Fixed clobbered registers in x86 translation.

28-Oct-2005
-----------
  - Added a non-JIT mode (not completely working now)
  - Added "-j" flag on the command line to disable JIT.
  - Fixed some stupid bugs in shift operations.

31-Oct-2005
-----------
  - Thanks to the great help of mtve, we have a working DEC21140 Ethernet
    driver and now the virtual C7200 can see the real world!!!

01-Nov-2005
-----------
  - Beginning of a NETIO module to handle network I/O with external world.
  - Studied (a bit) the PA-8T controller on a real router.
  - It is now possible to set the base MAC address of the router
    using the "-m" flag.
  - Improved logging
  - The dec21140 code is generalized and it is now possible to have a
    PA-FE-TX in any slot.

02-Nov-2005
-----------
  - Fixed some problems with the NVRAM when it is empty ;
  - Added a "net_io.c" module that is an abstraction layer
    for network communications (TAP, Unix sockets...)
  - Added the "virtual" MIPS "li" instruction which
    is in fact "addiu reg,zero,value". This permits to have
    a more optimized JIT code.
  - Code factorization in the DEC21140 module.
  - mtve (aka "Mtv Europe") sent a patch for much better console handling,
    merge is planned on 03-Nov.
  - Added a "PA driver" framework.

03-Nov-2005
-----------
  - The console is better handled: special keys are working, and there
    is a FIFO buffer to avoid character loss (added a "dev_vtty.c" module).
  - Merging with Mtve patch, that cleans NETIO module and adds features
    to the console.
  - Added a clock divisor hack, but it is not completely working.
    todo: implement a command line option for this.

08-Nov-2005
-----------
  - Mtve added tcp client/server NETIO.
  - The clock divisor is now working! It is set by the "-k" command line
    option.
  - Fixed the csr5 register handling in DEC21140 driver code.

13-Nov-2005
-----------
  - A lot of cosmetic changes from Mtve.
  - Modified the infrastructure to allow the use of CPU groups
    that share a certain number of devices (per-CPU device array).
    All device drivers have been modified to handle this.
  - Took a look at LSI ATMizer II+, which is the circuit used on
    PA-A3-OC3 boards. The ATMizer is based on a MIPS CPU, so it should
    be possible to emulate it.
  - Added a per-CPU dedicated thread.

23-Nov-2005
-----------
  - The PA-A1 ATM stuff is working!!!

24-Nov-2005
-----------
  - Fixed a bug in the PA-A1 driver in TX buffer chaining.

25-Nov-2005
-----------
  - Address bus masking, which clears bits 32 and 33 of physical addresses.
    It avoids the use of device aliasing.
  - Fixed the DEC21140 TX part which was incomplete.

29-Nov-2005
-----------
  - There are still bugs in big packet forwarding. This is probably the ATM
    driver (added more debugging info).
  - Fabien Devaux wrote a README explaining the command line options.

30-Nov-2005
-----------
  - Code cleanup in the net_io module.
  - Added the "ptask" (periodic tasks) module, this is mainly for TX ring
    scanning of network devices.

01-Dec-2005
-----------
  - Added a memory logger (FIFO of 10 accesses), this was useful to debug the
    PA-A1 RX problem.
  - Fixed a RX buffer chaining problem in PA-A1.

02-Dec-2005
-----------
  - Added support for PA-A1 reset ("clear int", "shut/no shut").
  - Optimized the IRQ handling (irq_pending flag in CPU structure
    is used as a "cache").

05-Dec-2005
-----------
  - Optimized the cp0 count/compare process for the x86_64 platform
    (unfortunately, this doesn't work for the x86 platform).

06-Dec-2005
-----------
  - Modified the NVRAM handling to allow calendar emulation ("sh calendar" is
    now working).

12-Dec-2005
-----------
  - Added support for the NPE-400.
  - Playing with the PA-POS-2OC3 (called "Charlotte" by Cisco).

24-Dec-2005
-----------
  - Added beginning of support for NPE-300 (endianness problems with PCI
    controllers ?)

28-Dec-2005
-----------
  - Fixed the endianness problem with the NPE-300.
  - Added NPE300-IO-FE.

31-Dec-2005
-----------
  - Added CLI option to load a symbol file.
  - Moved JIT code from dynamips.c to mips64_jit.c
  - Added support for NPE-100.
  - Updated the README file for NPE type selection.
  - Suppressed the annoying message "%%Error: Unrecognized I/O card in bay 0"

03-Jan-2006
-----------
  - The bit clearing in physical addresses was done stupidly.
    Only the bit 33 is used to bypass L2 caching.
    Re-introduced SRAM aliasing.
    PHY address 0x100000000 is in fact for PCI I/O space.
  - Began to play with the Cirrus Logic PD6729.
  - Added Bootflash based on Intel 28F008SA chips (1 Mb)
  - Fixed the alignment error occuring with "show version".

04-Jan-2006
-----------
  - Better understanding of Flash SIMM register with bank number and bank
    size: modified the Flash SIMM code to handle a 8 Mb flash in 1 bank
    (emulation of Intel 28F016SA chip) which should be sufficient to store
    crashinfo files or misc files like configs,...
  - Added ROM remote logging capabilities (with remote emulator control).

05-Jan-2006
-----------
  - Integrated HEC and AAL5 field computation functions found at:
    http://cell-relay.indiana.edu/cell-relay/publications/software/CRC/
    (Author is Charles Michael Heard).
  - Added HEC field management to the virtual ATM switch fabric.
  - Added HEC and AAL5 CRC fields to the TX part of the TNETA1570 driver.

06-Jan-2006
-----------
  - Added block timestamping, to evaluate use of JIT blocks and eventually
    enhance algorithm of block classifying.
  - Added a flag to the virtual devices to prevent use of MMAPed zones
    by MTS (used by NVRAM driver).
  - Added functions to extract IOS configuration from NVRAM.
    Pressing "Ctrl-] + c" nows write configuration to disk at any time.

08-Jan-2006
-----------
  - Added support for PEM (NPE-B) EEPROM. It will probably allow support
    of NPE-175/NPE-225.

09-Jan-2006
-----------
  - Added support for NPE-175/NPE-225 and added NPEB-IO-FE.

10-Jan-2006
-----------
  - Enhancements to the remote console over TCP port.
  - Port to the Cygwin environment, allowing the emulator to run on Windows
    machines!

11-Jan-2006
-----------
  - Added a feature to push an IOS configuration into NVRAM ("-C" command line
    option).
  - Added enhanced checks to the NVRAM config export.
  - Added a variant of udp_connect() function for systems that do not support
    RFC 2553.
  - Added support for AUX port (TCP port).

12-Jan-2006
-----------
  - Better memory logger.
  - Added breakpoint capabilities.
  - Fixed a segfault occuring on some IOS images with x86_64 JIT.
    (modified the minimum remaining size in JIT buffer adjustment).

13-Jan-2006
-----------
  - The ROM is now embedded in the source code (added an utility to convert
    ELF file to C code). It is possible to use an alternate ROM using the
    "-R" option.
  - Enhanced the MTS lookups to allow use of embedded ROM for code execution.

15-Jan-2006
-----------

  - Generalization of C7200-IO-FE driver for all NPE types.
  - Added Fault History support.
  - Added chassis selection (standard or VXR)
  - Finally found the bug in the non-jit emulation code! It was a cast problem
    in mult/multu instructions.

16-Jan-2006
-----------
  - Added generic hash tables.
  - Added "instruction lookup tables" (ILT), which greatly improve performance
    of non-JIT mode.
  - Added instruction statistics for the non-JIT mode ("Ctrl-] + j")

17-Jan-2006
-----------
  - Added a port for non-x86 hosts. The emulator ran successfully on a
    Tru64 Unix box (Alpha CPU)! It should also be able to compile and run
    on MacOS X (PowerPC).

24-Jan-2006
-----------
  - Added support for DMA channels on Galileo GT64k controllers since it seems
    that they may be used by IOS (NPE-400 for sure, other NPE?).

25-Jan-2006
-----------
  - Added Linux Raw Ethernet driver to the NetIO infrastructure.
  - Hmm, I'm probably missing something in the DMA/SRAM interaction and
    endianness...

26-Jan-2006
-----------
  - The DMA problem is finally fixed, in fact the SRAM can be accessed with
    byte-swapping.
  - Added an unicast limiter to the DEC21140, to receive only trafic directed
    to the virtual machine (+ multicast/broadcast). This is done by analyzing
    the setup frames (MAC address filter).

27-Jan-2006
-----------
  - The Linux Raw Ethernet driver needs promiscuous mode to be enabled to
    receive appropriate packets, added the required code.
  - Added endianness definitions, and replaced hton[sl]/ntoh[sl] by the new
    definitions (for exchanges between VM and host).

28-Jan-2006
-----------
  - Added parser infrastructure.

29-Jan-2006
-----------
  - Added a virtual bridge system.
  - Release 0.2.3b

31-Jan-2006
-----------
  - Fixed a stupid bug in DMA handling, which in certain conditions can
    cause an infinite loop.

01-Feb-2006
-----------
  - Added an "instruction block hash" which avoids lookups in the instruction
    red-black tree. The IBH table takes only 16 Kb of memory.
  - Added CRC-12 and CRC-16 functions for future use.
  - Added a "gen_eth" NetIO driver, which allow to access ethernet interfaces
    in a portable way (tested on Linux and Cygwin).
  - Fixes to the PowerPC build on Darwin thanks to Olivier Cahagne.
  - Minor cosmetic changes to display supported/unsupported PA and NPE.
  - Release 0.2.3c

06-Feb-2006
-----------
  - Added working Serial interfaces (PA-4T+) !
  - Bug: CDP not working with serial interfaces ("debug cdp events" reports
    a checksum problem).

07-Feb-2006
-----------
  - Started the 0.2.4 release.
  - Modified the command line parser to allow many NIO per PA (for example
    for serials).
  - A lot of code cleanups in the C7200 initialization.
  - Added PA-8T support.
  - To fix: CDP with Serial interfaces: using cp_len (instead of cp_len+4)
    in packet rx fixes the problem but breaks IP. Probably something related
    to padding, see how a CDP packet is sent (special flag in tx ring ?)
  - Added virtual "beqz" instruction.
  - Added the "-X" option, allowing to use host memory directly instead of
    mapping a file to simulate RAM (faster).
  - Beginning of code reorganization to allow multiple instance contexts.

08-Feb-2006
-----------
  - Added a basic virtual Frame-Relay switch. Unfortunately, LMI must be
    implemented to maintain links up.
  - Finally found the problem related to CDP! It was simply a padding problem.

09-Feb-2006
-----------
  - Add support of promiscuous mode for the DEC21140 "unicast limiter":
    promiscuous mode is used in bridging configurations.
  - Fixed another bug with the serial interfaces: it seems that there is
    a "length substractor" for the txring.

10-Feb-2006
-----------
  - Played a little with the PA-POS-OC3, without success.

14-Feb-2006
-----------
  - Finally implemented the basic LMI stuff (only ANSI Annex D). Fortunately,
    IOS rocks and uses auto-detection, so no extra configuration is needed.
  - Integrated a Makefile patch from Max Khon for FreeBSD.
  - Updated documentation.
  - Release 0.2.4.

15-Feb-2006
-----------
  - Fixed a cosmetic bug when displaying MAC address at startup.
  - Fixed a stupid bug in "srav" instruction in x86_64 JIT code. The
    arithmetic shift operation was done on a 64-bit basic instead of 32-bit,
    causing bad propagation of the sign-bit.
  - Added support for multiple instances (no CLI present yet).

17-Feb-2006
-----------
  - Fixed 2 bugs in Frame-Relay switch: a crash occured when receiving
    a packet gave an error, and if many DLCI with the same ID on different
    interfaces were used, only one was announced on one interface.

18-Feb-2006
-----------
  - Began work on advanced configuration parsing (instances).

19-Feb-2006
-----------
  - Is the count/compare mechanism pertinent ?

23-Feb-2006
-----------
  - Continued work on advanced config parsing (instances,NIO).
  - Added registry infrastructure.
  - Fixed some mistakes in documentation.

28-Feb-2006
-----------
  - Continued work on advanced config parsing (NIO).
  - Added an IRQ counter.
  - Continued debugging on recurrent crashes problem.
  - Added proper checks to mts32_raw_lookup (at least it avoids the
    coredump...)
  - Added display of all CP0 registers (except TLB).

02-Mar-2006
-----------
  - Hardened a little the IRQ subsystem, but this doesn't fix the problem.
  - Added a debugging mode to track jumps to address 0 (x86_64 only!).
  - Fixed the teq/teqi instructions in amd64/x86 modes that were buggy.

04-Mar-2006
-----------
  - Added some assembly optimized routines for x86 hosts.
  - Fixed a stupid bug in mts32_raw_lookup (op_size and op_type were
    swapped).

06-Mar-2006
-----------
  - Added Unix and Null NETIO types for config files.
  - Fixes for incorrect behavior in virtual memory access routines, in
    case of exception.

08-Mar-2006

-----------
  - Added basic hypervisor infrastructure.
  - Added basic NIO code to the hypervisor commands.

10-Mar-2006
-----------
  - Added the hypervisor NIO code.
  - Added Frame-Relay and ATM switches to the hypervisor commands.

11-Mar-2006
-----------
  - Played (successfully) with OIR (Online Insertion and Removal). OIR
    will require device deletion...

-----------
  - Fixed EEPROM code which used global variables.
  - Added the necessary code for basic OIR.
  - Added PCI device removal.

15-Mar-2006

  - Added a basic ns16552 driver.

17-Mar-2006
-----------
  - Added some hypervisor commands for PA setup and OIR.

20-Mar-2006
-----------
  - Hardened the Mueslix driver: after OIR, a "no shut" on a new interface
    crashed the virtual router. Now, IRQ status is managed appropriately.

24-Mar-2006
-----------
  - Added ptask (periodic task) removal.
  - Added a basic (nearly empty) C3600 IO FPGA chip.

25-Mar-2006
-----------
  - Added a NIO RX multiplexer.
  - Added NIO unset operation for PA.

26-Mar-2006
-----------
  - Modified the virtual ATM/Frame-Relay switches and NIO bridge to use
    the new NIO RX multiplexer.

  - Added hypervisor commands for PA removal and to display C7200 hardware.
  - Fixed a bug in PCI device removal.
  - It's now possible to change cards on the fly!
  - The Mueslix driver was incorrectly modified: the TX ring scanner must
    run even if the NIO is not defined.
  - Modified the DEC21140 driver to report a Link Down when the NIO is not
    defined.

04-Apr-2006
-----------
  - Added packet dump (for debugging) to NetIO receive/send operations.

08-Apr-2006
-----------
  - The SMP bug seems to be fixed! The irq_cause field is now manipulated
    atomically (inline asm for x86 and x86_64, pthread mutex on other 
    machines).

12-Apr-2006
-----------
  - Added a VM abstraction layer (for different platforms).
  - Fix of X86 assembly file for Cygwin.
  - The IOS config file is now saved with a specific filename from the
    VM instance.

13-Apr-2006
-----------
  - Added per-instance logfile.

14-Apr-2006
-----------
  - Fixed a stupid bug in non-JIT mode with IRQs.

  - bugfix: mueslix logging.
  - bugfix: adding an NIO to the RX listener list (bad double linked-list)
  - bugfix: bad fgets() use in NIO bridge and ATM/FR switches.

18-Apr-2006
-----------
  - bugfix: the same NIO could be recorded many times in the NIO RX
    multiplexer due to bad design in NIO adding.

19-Apr-2006
-----------
  - Beginning of work on AMD Am79c971 ethernet controller (used by PA-4E
    and PA-8E).

  - Study of GT64120 controller to understand address decoding process.

28-Apr-2006
-----------
  - Fixed a bug with NPE-175/NPE-225 PEM EEPROM selection.

  - Added VTTY deletion.
  - Added "c7200 stop" command to the hypervisor (not finished).
  - The memory-mapped devices of port adapters are now enabled dynamically,
    depending on the PCI BAR (Base Address Registers) settings. This avoids
    use of hardcoded values.
  - Integrated a patch from Philipp Brenner, which fixes ELF loading problem
    on Cygwin when default text file type is set to DOS. Many thanks to him.
    (symptom was: "load_elf_image: elf_begin: I/O error: raw read")

    producing a segfault (seen on windows machines).

26-May-2006
-----------
  - Played with the PA-POS-OC3 driver, it seems that it is working. Need
    to check if the TX ring guess is correct (ie, with "routing" conditions).

27-May-2006
-----------
  - PA-POS-OC3: Fixed the TX ring part to work with multiple buffers. There 
    is still a problem with buffer addresses (doesn't work with platforms 
    using SRAM).

29-May-2006
-----------

    chip (FPGA ?) is present on PA-FE-TX and C7200-IO-FE to add the second
    FCS field.
  - Added basic disassembly code (need to do something more generic).

04-Jun-2006

    (seems to be at a different address?)

08-Jun-2006
-----------
  - NVRAM is now ok on NPE-G1 (it is at a different physical address).

13-Jun-2006
-----------
  - Optimizations on fast lw/sw operations (x86 only for now).
  - Changed offset size for branches (x86_jump32 instead of x86_jump8).

-----------
  - Some code cleanup for the new JIT compiler.
  - bugfix: PA-4T+/PA-8T not working with IOS 12.0T (incorrect device length).
    (BTS entry #23).
  - Added JIT flush to limit the memory used for translation. At this time,
    this is basic, we count the number of translated pages and we flush when
    this number reaches a threshold (512 pages seems to be a good value).
  - Integrated a patch from Philipp Brenner (BTS entry #21)
    Description: "In standard mode it intercepts SIGINT and sends a CTRL+C
    (0x03) to the target's vtty_con buffer, while in hypervisor mode it
    gracefully shuts down the hypervisor which causes the application to
    quit."

04-Jul-2006
-----------
  - Fixed a stupid bug in mts_cache (phys_page boundary not checked).
  - Optimized JIT flushing and insn block allocation.
  - Changed the maximum number of translated pages to 2048, which seems to
    be a more adequate value.

05-Jul-2006
-----------
  - Added an "exec zone" which is a pool of host executable pages. This
    zone is limited by default to 64 Mb for Linux/Unix and 16 Mb for Cygwin.
    When the zone is fully used, the JIT structures are flushed (removed the
    maximum number of translated pages).
    Now, there is no need to disable ExecShield or similar systems.
  - Added explicit error message when failing to open an ELF file.
  - Fixed getopt_long() usage.
  - Added CLI option "--exec-area <size>" to define exec zone size for the
    default VM.

07-Jul-2006
-----------
  - Added command line help for "--exec-area" option.
  - Updated documentation.

11-Jul-2006
-----------
  - bugfix: missing pointer cleanup in c7200_pa_shutdown() (BTS entry #30)
  - bugfix: incomplete shutdown code for NIO (little memory leak + no
    freeing code for NIO with null type).
  - bugfix: memory leak in udp_connect() + incorrect error checking.
  - Added cleanup code for general log file.
  - bugfix: memory leak in hypervisor command execution.
  - Added logging for hypervisor commands.

    build.
  - Added definition for mmap() MAP_ANONYMOUS flag for systems where only
    MAP_ANON is defined.

18-Jul-2006
-----------
  - Fixed inter-pages jumps in delay slots (reported by nula)
  - Added a check preventing to run the idle-pc feature when an idle-pc value
    is already defined (since it would give biased results).
  - bugfix: VTTY list not locked in vtty_create()
  - bugfix: ensure the CPU is running before incrementing pending timer IRQs.
  - Added a checklist for minimal C7200 hardware components. It checks good
    init of ram, rom, nvram and zero devices.

  - Some work on JIT tuning (flush).

20-Jul-2006
-----------
  - Better info logging for VTTY and C7200 modules.

  - Fixed a bug with select() on Cygwin platform: before, only 64 FDs
    could be used.

24-Jul-2006
-----------
  - bugfix: accept_fd was not closed in VTTY module (BTS entry #42)
  - bugfix: properly handle CR/LF in configuration files (FR, ATM, ...)
    (BTS entry #36)
  - bugfix: accept fd not correctly printed in log file.
  - Added a mini-parser for hypervisor: allows directory with blanks, ...
  - bugfix: bad use of setsockopt() in the hypervisor.

    ("nio create_null" command).
  - Added a FIFO NetIO for intra-hypervisor communications.
  - Merged a patch from Peter Ross for incorrect idle-pc parsing with 64-bit
    values.
  - Non-JIT mode optimization for instruction fetch (although it could be
    enhanced again).
  - Various code cleanups.

26-Jul-2006
-----------
  - Added "ethsw clear_mac_addr_table" to clear MAC address table of a
    virtual ethernet switch.
  - Added "ethsw show_mac_addr_table" to show all MAC addresses learnt by
    a virtual ethernet switch.
  - Fixed a potential bug with jalr/jr instructions, where the stack is used
    to save the return PC. If the instruction in the delay slot returned
    directly to the jit main loop (exception,...), the stack would be in
    an inconsistent state. This fix is also required for Darwin/x86.

27-Jul-2006
-----------
  - Stack alignment for Darwin/x86 in memop functions and unknown opcode
    handling.
  - The Darwin/x86 build requires -mdynamic-no-pic as compilation option.
  - Fixed some inline assembly mistakes with "lock" prefix.

    => problems: * no keepalive required for NM-1E/NM-1FE (media status ?)
	         * NM-4T packet delivery failure when end of RX ring is hit.

06-Aug-2006
-----------
  - Modified Am79c971 MII registers to keep the link up in FastEthernet mode.
  - Merged a patch from Peter Ross for Console and AUX ports optimizations
    (especially with TCP mode)

-----------
  - Continuing on PA-4B (trying to understand TP3420).

10-Aug-2006
-----------
  - C7200: Added PA Mgmt IRQ support (required for PA-4B, seen on a real
    c7200 with PA-4B offered by Vernon Missouri).
  - Added TP3420 definitions.

  - Fixed a bug in VTTY flushing.

20-Aug-2006
-----------
  - Added code to gen_eth module for Cygwin to prevent WinPCAP from giving
    back transmitted packets. It requires WinPCAP 0.4-alpha1 or better.
    TODO: need to be tested!

21-Aug-2006
-----------
  - Fixed C3660 boot. Trying to understand/discover the hardware.
    Environmental monitor should be ok.

  - C3600: the DUART irq is now higly prioritized. It gives better console
    reactivity.

30-Aug-2006
-----------
  - Huge performance improvement on dec21140 and am79c971 drivers, by
    transmitting up to 16 packets in one TX ring scan pass.
  - Added the same to Serial driver (untested).
  - Added "unicast limiter" feature to the am79c971 driver, similarly to the
    dec21140 driver. Not having this caused the virtual instances to see
    unrelated host traffic when using linux_eth/gen_eth NIO and consequently
    a bad performance was obtained. Thanks to Greg for noticing that.
  - Beginning of rework of PCI subsystem for PCI bridge support.
    (Greg noticed that with 12.2T releases, the PCI bus numbering is
    different for the C3660).

31-Aug-2006
-----------
  - Finished the PCI subsystem rework.
  - C7200: Fixed PCI bridge use for midplanes (std: dec21050, vxr: dec21150).

01-Sep-2006
-----------
  - Finally fixed the Serial problem on C3620 platform (hack in the driver
    to trigger interrupts differently).
  - Cleanup for VM PCI bus pool and C7200 "hidden" I/O bridge was missing.

03-Sep-2006
-----------
  - Added safety checks to the PCI bus management.
  - Added a PLX9060 device (very basic for now).
  - Rewritten the PA-POS-OC3 driver to use the new PLX9060 driver.
  - Cleanup: removed use of c7200 bay info in drivers (everything uses
    PCI for configuration).
  - C7200: removed the bay module which contained static definitions of
    PCI bus, physical addresses for PA, ... Now everything is handled
    dynamically by the PCI subsystem and the remaining drivers (PA-4B,
    PA-POS-OC3) have been fixed.

------------------------------------------------
   - Added NVRAM filesystem.
   - Added generic_nvram_extract_config and generic_nvram_push_config that use the NVRAM filesystem.

   - Bumped version to v0.2.9.

Fixed issue #11 - nvram:private-config is destroyed when we write nvram:startup-config
Fixed issue #13 - C3745 has an emulated NVRAM that is not continuous, so we can generate an invalid checksum when the config is written
Fixed issue #14 - a file descriptor is leaked every time the config is extracted/read

+-------------------.
| Release:  v0.2.9   |
+-------------------'

05-Aug-2013 to 07-Sep-2013
--------------------------
   - Add an option to produce debug symbols and override the optimization level to the makefiles.
   - Fix leak of a mutex and a condition if thread creation fails in timer_create_queue.
   - Remove unnecessary call to pthread_exit, the main thread is waiting with pthread_join.
   - Add volatile qualifier to variables 'list' and 'running' of timer_queue_t. They are modified and read in different threads.
   - Remove the asynchronous cancellation of the timer threads. It is not safe and pthread_cancel is never called.
   - Signal the timer queue condition before releasing the mutex, as it should be used.
   - Check the running flag before waiting for the condition in timer_loop. This avoids "The Lost Wake-Up Problem" when the program terminates before the timer thread is waiting.

   - Rework m_read_file to read the whole file at once.
   - Rework vm_nvram_push_config to handle both config files (NULL to keep existing data).
   - Extend hypervisor command 'set_config':
     - new optional argument for the file with private data.
     - new behaviour: an empty string "" means no config file.
   - Rework vm_ios_set_config to handle both config files (NULL to keep existing data).
   - Update documentation.
   - Extend hypervisor command 'extract_config':
     - return both startup-config and private-config data.
     - empty data is sent as an empty string ''.
   - Update documentation.
   - Extend hypervisor command 'push_config':
     - new optional argument for the private data.
     - new behavior: the string '(keep)' means no data is provided and it should preserve existing data.
   - Update documentation.
   - Add command line options --private-config and --startup-config.
   - Update documentation.
   - Fix warning "dereferencing type-punned pointer will break strict-aliasing rules".
   - Fix m32_tx_acquire not checking the HOLD bit properly.
     Note: the datasheet isn't available anymore, so the intended behavior was inferred from surrounding code; it was assumed that the hold bit is managed elsewhere
   - Fix warning "suggest parentheses around operand of ‘!’ or change ‘&’ to ‘&&’ or ‘!’ to ‘~’".
   - Fix warnings "assignment discards ‘const’ qualifier from pointer target type" by copying the backplane/supervisor eeproms.
   - Fix memory leaks of c6sup1_t.slot_eeprom data.

   - Fix warnings "variable ‘<name>’ set but not used".
     delete unneeded variables that don't help understand the surrounding code
     __maybe_unused for the other variables
   - Adjust Makefiles:
     - clean nvram_export.o
     - add missing $(BIN_EXT)
     - add target 'both' to facilitate test compilations

--------------------------
   - Missing space in hypervisor_mode.7 manpage (line 310)
   - gt96k: more debug info
   - Fix packet looping on platforms with Gt96k FE.
     - The specs were not clear on whether the M-bit was a "Miss" or "Match".
     - It was being treated as a "Match" bit but it turns out IOS treats it as a "Miss" bit.
     @see http://forum.gns3.net/post26316.html#p26316
   - Gt96k patch correcting the reporting of processed transmit descriptors back to IOS.
     - Fixes missing interrupt when gt96k doesn't own the first trasmit descriptor.
     - Fixes incorrect clearing of the Own bit. (last must wait for transmission, the rest are cleared when processed)
     - Fixes offset when writing back the cmd word of the non-last descriptors. (missing from 0.2.6-RC3)
     - Affects c2691, c3725 and c3745.
     @see http://forum.gns3.net/post26454.html#p26454
   - Clarify the meaning of the +4 offsets with GT_SDMA_CMD_OFFSET.
   - Silence forgotten debug message.
   - Change default idlemax value from 1500 to 500.
   - Add hypervisor command 'vm_debug pmem_cfind'.
   - Bump version to v0.2.12.

Fixed issue #29 - packet loss with multicast traffic
Closed issue #31 - create hypervisor command to find a pattern in the router memory
